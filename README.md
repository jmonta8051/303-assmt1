# 303-assmt1
A program that reads data from an input file into a one dimentional array with various vector functionalities coded in.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The menu is very self-explanatory, just follow the instructions it'll give you.
If the screen doesn't clear and becomes very cluttered, consider switching to Linux for best possible performance.
I don't know how to add screenshots to Github and there's not really a way for me to capture my code 'working' in just screenshots.

Bon apetite!
